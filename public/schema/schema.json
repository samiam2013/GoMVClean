these files are accessible publicly from the website while it's running

I realized I don't want any of the database schema to be public at all,

because this code has gone through many iterations and someone might want

to try this apporoach (javascript pulling schema JSONs for verifying output)

then they're welcome to, but I'm not sure why you would ever want your user

to know anything about your model, that's marginally dangerous.

the new config file for the public model is going to be put in

/publicModelConfig

not /public/schema/
