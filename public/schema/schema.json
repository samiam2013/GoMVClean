/*
ELHO these are the JSON table schemas

THIS will be telling user javascript where to query
then, in descending cascade,
tell routeModel.go how to read-only or read-write the database
with these JSON arrays

you need to add each new public facing schema file as you create
new publicly readable folders, unless the information needs to remain
hidden, like the CSRF tokens in public/updateStream/blobs

by default the codebase does not create the /blobs folder.
