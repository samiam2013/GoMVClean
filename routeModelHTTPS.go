// I have to figure out how to run https queries against the modeling
// and run them concurrently with the implemented model system
// this involves writing a regex so that model.go's creation ->
// 			/public/*table/*column/*row/schema
// becomes /public/*table/*column/*row/schema.json for the row schemaFile
// but is only the request path from the user, in reality.
// public/schema has links to the tables.
// public/table/schema has links to the rows
// public/table/row/schema has links to the data columns by hashed id

//functionally equivalent to

// if !stringContains(r.URL.Path,"schema")
//    updateStream(w, r)
