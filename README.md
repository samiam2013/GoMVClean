# GoMVClean [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/samiam2013/goMVClean)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/samiam2013/goMVClean)
Go Website Template [not a framework] Written for Native-Only Dependencies

The goal is to have a singleton-pattern binary-compiled MVC framework.

Mostly an attempt to implement the most lightweight and obvious-structured Go website that I could. 

The database is raw text files formatted in JSON, nothing is required except for a simple Golang installation and you're ready to modify a website with CSRF tokens and a partially finished user signup form.
