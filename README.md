# GoMVClean [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/samiam2013/goMVClean)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/samiam2013/goMVClean)
Go Website Template Written for Native-Only Dependencies

The goal is to have a singleton-pattern binary-compiled MVC framework that makes
sense when it's finished.

You're welcome to play with this code, but it is not yet finished.

It documents itself, because it's static HTML and all you need is `go build` in the main directory
and then run the binary, whatever it's named on windows or linux, I code on windows and host on linux
so it has to run on both anyway.

To get it to upload csrf tokens into the public folder, you have to create the
public/updateStream/blobs folder

I have a small business I'm building this for and the example code is up at it's
domain: https://www.dronetriage.com

My idea is to make a graphing database and binary website that puts UAVs, drones
or helicopters, or even RC planes that are part of automated networks into a
shape that allows you to "Google"-a-drone for whatever you need, whenever you
need it, be it search and rescue or filming a wedding in 6 months. The small
business idea will eventually become a hybrid networked and human operated
drone triage infrastructure.
